## Backend (Laravel 11 API)

The Inventory API is built using Laravel 11, supporting the following:

- **User Roles**: Admin, Purchase, Distribution.
- **Inventory Management**: Handles purchase and distribution records.
- **RESTful API** with endpoints for managing users, products, purchases, and distributions.

| PUT    | `/api/products/{id}`  | Update product details       |
| DELETE | `/api/products/{id}`  | Delete a product             |
| POST   | `/api/purchases`      | Record a product purchase    |
| POST   | `/api/distributions`  | Record product distribution  |

---

## Frontend (ReactJS)

The Inventory Frontend, built in ReactJS, provides a user interface to manage products, purchases, and distributions.

### Key Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of stock levels and activities.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete products.
- **Purchase and Distribution Tracking**: Manage inventory flow.
- **Role-based Access**: Different views for admin, purchase, and distribution users.

---

## Environment Variables

Both the Laravel API and React app require environment variables.

### Backend (Laravel)

In `inventory-api/.env`, set the following variables:

```plaintext
APP_NAME=InventoryAPI
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### Frontend (React)

In `inventory-app/.env` (create this if it doesn't exist), set the following:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

---

## Running the Application

1. Start the Laravel API server:
   ```bash
   cd inventory-api
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Start the React frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../inventory-app
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and will interact with the API running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
